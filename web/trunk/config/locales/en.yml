  intro: 
    title: "Turn your mobile phone into an environmental sensor and participate to the monitoring of noise pollution"
    paragraph: "<p>Noise pollution is a serious problem in many cities. NoiseTube is a research project, started in 2008 at the <a href=\"http://www.csl.sony.fr\">Sony Computer Science Lab in Paris</a>, which aims to develop a new participative approach for monitoring noise pollution by involving the general public. Our ambitious goal is to extend the current usage of mobile phones by turning them into noise sensors enabling citizens to measure their own exposure in their everyday environment. Furthermore each user can also participate to the creation of a collective map of noise pollution by sharing the geolocalized measurement data with the NoiseTube community.</p><p>By installing the <a href=\"/download\">free app</a> on your smartphone, you will be able to measure the level of noise in dB(A) (with a precision a bit lower than a sound level meter), and contribute to collective noise mapping effort by annotating it (tagging, e.g. subjective level of annoyance), next this information can be automatically published on this website (3G/GPRS or manual upload on any PC).</p>"
